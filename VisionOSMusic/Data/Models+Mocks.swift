 Lashing out the action
 
 Returning a reaction
 
 Weak are ripped and torn away
 
 Hypnotizing power
 
 Crushing all that cower
 
 Battery is here to stay
 
 Smashing through the boundaries
 
 Lunacy has found me
 
 Cannot stop the battery

 Pounding out aggression
 
 Turns into obsession
 
 Cannot kill the battery
 
 Cannot kill the family
 
 Battery is found in me

 Crushing all deceivers
 
 Mashing non-believers
 
 Never ending potency
 
 Hungry violence seeker
 
 Feeding off the weaker
 
 Breeding on insanity

 Battery is found in me
 
 Battery
 
 Battery
 
 โช
 
 Circle of destruction
 
 Hammer comes crushing
 
 Powerhouse of energy
 
 Whipping up a fury
 
 Dominating flurry
 
 We create the battery
 
 Smashing through the boundaries
 
 Lunacy has found me
 
 Cannot stop the battery
 
 โช
 
 Pounding out aggression
 
 Turns into obsession
 
 Cannot kill the battery
 
 Cannot kill the family
 
 Battery is found in me
 
 Battery
 
 Battery
 
 Battery
 
 Battery
